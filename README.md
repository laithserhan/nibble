# Nibble

A Fantasy Console, designed to run on *real* hardware and with a strong focus on
UX and design.

# Getting Started

First, you will need to download the emulator and SDK from the
[releases](https://github.com/nibbleteam/nibble/releases) page.

The macOS version probably needs some tinkering to run, because it's not notarized by Apple.

After extracting the `.zip` file you can run the `nibble` executable.

You will be greeted by the shell.

You can type the name of any software to start it.
